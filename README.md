Q To M

Inspiration
-----------
[This website](https://addcninblue.github.io/atoz/) was the inspiration for this project. I wanted to make it more fun for people can't type fast, so this project was born.

How to Play
-----------
To play this game, just start swiping from q to m on your keyboard. It's pretty self-explanatory, and there's a help page.

Bugs
----
If there's a bug, feel free to create an issue and I will make @addcninblue fix it. :)
